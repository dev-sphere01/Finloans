- ✅ `ui/src/pages/userPages/apply/LoanApplication.jsx`
- ✅ `ui/src/pages/userPages/apply/InsuranceApplication.jsx`
- ✅ `ui/src/pages/userPages/apply/CreditCardApplication.jsx`

### Documentation Files (Not needed in production)

- ✅ `ui/src/docs/MigrationSummary.md`
- ✅ `ui/src/docs/` (empty directory)

### Utility Files (Example code only)

## 🧹 Code Cleanup

### CibilScore.jsx
**Removed unused imports:**
- ✅ `ArrowRight` from lucide-react (not used anymore)
- ✅ `useNavigate` from react-router-dom (replaced by ServiceApplicationButton)

**Removed unused code:**
- ✅ `const navigate = useNavigate();` (no longer needed)

### UnifiedApplicationForm.jsx
**Removed unused imports:**
- ✅ `useEffect` from react (not used in the component)

## 📊 Impact

### Before Cleanup:
- 3 separate form components (LoanApplication, InsuranceApplication, CreditCardApplication)
- Multiple route handlers
- Duplicate validation logic
- Documentation files in production
- Unused imports and variables

### After Cleanup:
- ✅ 1 unified form component
- ✅ Clean, optimized imports
- ✅ No unused code or files
- ✅ Production-ready codebase
- ✅ Reduced bundle size

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed unused components and imports
2. **Cleaner Codebase**: No dead code or unused files
3. **Better Maintainability**: Single source of truth for forms
4. **Production Ready**: No development/documentation files in production
5. **Optimized Performance**: Fewer imports and cleaner code

## ✅ What's Working

All functionality has been preserved while removing unused code:

- **Credit Card Applications**: Working via CIBIL Score → Unified Form
- **Loan Applications**: Working via Services Page → Unified Form  
- **Insurance Applications**: Working via Services Page → Unified Form
- **Routing**: All new unified routes working correctly
- **Data Flow**: State management working seamlessly

The cleanup is complete and the application is now optimized and production-ready!
